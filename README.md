# Redesign Cow PWA

## Description

Redesign cow is a back end downloadable text editor. <br>
This web application can be installed to make use of the text editor while offline. <br>
Installing an application using a service worker, solves the problem of using the application while not having to be online. <br>
I learned that webpack can help to bundle all the css and javascript files into a separate folder, so applocation can then be downloaded and used offline. 


## Installation

On the terminal, write "npm install" to install all the packages used for webpack to work. <br>
After intstalling packages, write "npm run build" to run the script that will bundle all the files into the 'dist' folder. 

## Usage

On a browser go to: https://redesigned-cow.onrender.com <br>
Once inside the website, click on the "install" button located at the upper left corner <br><br>

Redesign cow text editor will download to your desktop and can be used offline.
